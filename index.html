            <h1>ATM Interface: Personas and Storyboarding</h1>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <div class="overview-container">
                <div>
                    <img class="sketch" src="./gallery/interface-sketch.jpg" alt="ATM interface sketch">

                <div class="overview-text">
                        The user is prompted to insert their card and then is asked to choose from a number of banking services they&#39;d like to access, 
                        such as cash withdrawal or checking their account balance. 
                        This interface is automating a number of basic financial services which don&#39;t require face-to-face interaction with a bank teller,
                        thereby allowing the bank to serve more customers, as the ATMs only require servicing from a human periodically, 
                        and they can be placed in locations that are more convenient to the customers, allowing them to skip a trip to the bank. 
                        Once you insert your card and choose what function you want to do, you use the numerical buttons and the buttons on the interface screen to enter info, 
                        then you are given the cash you requested (if you are making a withdrawal), as well as a receipt.

            <h2>Observations of Real Users</h2>
            <h3>Three users were observed during their interaction with the ATM interface.</h3>
            <div id="observations-container">
                <div class="observation-item">
                    <h4 class="observation-title">User 1</h4>
                    <p class="observation-text">
                        This user is using the ATM machine to check their balance and to make a withdrawal. 
                        I noticed the user getting frustrated that the screen interface buttons weren&#39;t particularly responsive to touch. 
                        The user also expressed frustration that the way the interface was set up caused them to almost accidentally confirm when they had entered the incorrect amount. 
                        They also were irritated about the ATM fee that they incurred during the transaction due to the fact that they do not bank with the bank that owns the ATM. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="observation-item">
                    <h4 class="observation-title">User 2</h4>
                    <p class="observation-text">
                        The user is using the ATM machine to make a withdrawal. 
                        I noticed they repeatedly tried to use the contactless card reader 
                        instead of inserting their card (which I did confirm was contactless-enabled), 
                        but either the card reader was broken or their card was not compatible with the ATM reader 
                        (perhaps because it was not a Bank of America-issued card). 
                        The user paused for a significant period of time when it asked them 
                        what type of account they wanted to withdraw from (checking or savings), 
                        perhaps indicating that they didn’t know their account type. 
                        The user was hoping to withdraw $35 to purchase their GCB membership, 
                        however, the ATM would only let her withdraw cash in $10 increments, 
                        which she found annoying. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="observation-item">
                    <h4 class="observation-title">User 3</h4>
                    <p class="observation-text">
                        The user is using the ATM machine to make a withdrawal. 
                        I noticed again that the user was getting frustrated that 
                        the screen interface buttons aren’t particularly responsive to touch. 
                        Additionally, this user did accidentally press the wrong button for the 
                        amount she wanted to withdraw, and she actually did accidentally confirm 
                        the transaction before she could correct her mistake. 
                        She expressed frustration that she wished the machine made it clearer 
                        that she was about to confirm the transaction and the amount she 
                        was going to be withdrawing. Perhaps she was in a rush and did not fully 
                        read all of the prompts.

            <div class="questions-container">
                <h2>Questions</h2>
                <h3>The observed users were asked the following questions in order to gauge their experience with the interface. Their answers are summarized below. </h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>What is the task you are trying to accomplish by using the atm machine 
                        (e.g. withdrawal, check balance, deposit a check)? 
                        What prompted you to come to the atm machine 
                        (as opposed to online check deposit, using a credit card instead of cash, for example)? 
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                All three users I interviewed wanted to make a withdrawal. 
                                Two users mentioned they needed cash for a specific purpose, 
                                such as frequenting a business that only accepted cash or tipping a service worker. 
                                No users mentioned they were withdrawing cash because they needed to have some around more generally. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                One of the three users was also interested in checking their balance. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>How frequently do you use atm machines in general, or this one in particular?
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Two out of the three users interviewed responded that they rarely use ATM machines in general, 
                                as they don’t really have a need for cash.  
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                One user responded that they visit ATM machines whenever they are required to 
                                because they are frequenting a business that is cash only. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Were you able to complete the task you set out to accomplish by coming to the atm machine? 
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                All users were able to withdraw money (and check their balance where applicable). 
                            </li>  
                            <li>
                                One user reported not being able to accomplish the task they set out to, 
                                because they weren’t able to withdraw the exact amount they needed due to the ATM requiring withdrawals in $20 increments. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>What parts of your interaction with the atm interface were frustrating? 
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Two users reported being frustrated with the contactless card reader on the machine. 
                                Between the three users, they tried a physical BofA contactless card, 
                                the mobile version of a BofA contactless card using Apple Pay, 
                                and a contactless card associated with another bank, 
                                and none of the three users had success. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                One user reported frustration with the fact that they could only withdraw cash in $20 increments. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Another user was frustrated because they had accidentally withdrawn an incorrect amount. 
                                They said this was because the interface did not have a confirm button, 
                                so they didn’t know where they were in the process of getting money. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>   
                    </li>
                    <li>At any point were you unsure of how to proceed? 
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                One user reported confusion due to the buttons on the screen being unresponsive to their touch 
                                (or the interface being slow to respond), making them unsure of how to proceed. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Another user reported confusion associated with the contactless card not working. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>What could have been improved about your overall experience or your interaction with the interface? 
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                For the user who wanted to both check their balance and make a withdrawal, 
                                they reported that the experience could have been improved had they not had to re-insert their card for each separate function. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Multiple users reported that they wished they had been able to take out cash in smaller increments. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Multiple users also would have liked the interface to have included clearer instructions for how to user the contactless card reader. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The user who accidentally withdrew the incorrect amount would have liked the 
                                interface to have been clearer about when the transaction was going to be confirmed. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Would you use the atm machine again? 
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                All users reported that they would use the ATM machine again. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>
